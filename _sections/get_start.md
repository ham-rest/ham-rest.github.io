# Base Info

Welcome to the **Hamravesh API Essentials**! This section is your foundation for harnessing the full power of the Hamravesh API in your applications. Let’s dive into the core requirements and ensure you're set up for seamless API integration.

## Getting Started with Hamravesh API

Before making any requests, you’ll need an **API Key**. This key is unique to you and acts as a secure identifier that allows your application to access Hamravesh’s resources. Your API Key ensures that only authorized requests are processed, protecting your data and keeping your application secure.

### Generate Your API Key

1. **Log in to the Hamravesh Console**: Go to the [Hamravesh Console](https://console.hamravesh.com/) and sign in with your account.
2. **Navigate to API Settings**: In the main dashboard, locate the “Profile” section and then [api-key](https://console.hamravesh.com/profile/api-keys) page.
3. **Create a New API Key**: Follow the prompts to generate your API Key. Once created, securely save it, as it will be needed for all API requests.
4. **Keep It Safe**: Your API Key is like a password—keep it private and avoid sharing it. If compromised, you can revoke and regenerate a new key from the console.
