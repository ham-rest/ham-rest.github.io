# Authentication

### Generate Your API Key

1. **Log in to the Hamravesh Console**: Go to the [Hamravesh Console](https://console.hamravesh.com/) and sign in with your account.
2. **Navigate to API Settings**: In the main dashboard, locate the “Profile” section and then [api-key](https://console.hamravesh.com/profile/api-keys) page.
3. **Create a New API Key**: Follow the prompts to generate your API Key. Once created, securely save it, as it will be needed for all API requests.
4. **Keep It Safe**: Your API Key is like a password—keep it private and avoid sharing it. If compromised, you can revoke and regenerate a new key from the console.
